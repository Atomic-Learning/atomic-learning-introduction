<h2>Welcome to the Atomic Learning Platform</h2>

<p> Welcome to the Atomic Learning platform! This page is an introduction and minimal tutorial for using the platform. The platform is designed to provide a wide range of teaching resources created by experts across Imperial College London. The platform itself provides tools to allow you to navigate through these resources easily and effectively. </p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>The <b>content</b> on the Atomic Learning platform is divided into a large number of different pages. Each page is intended to be the smallest useful unit of information. Each page will note which other pages are a <b>prerequisite</b> to it, forming a web of interconnected knowledge. As you view content, you should complete it, telling the platform you've viewed it.</p>

<h2>Goals and Your Queue</h2>

<p> Within the platform you can designate a piece of content as a <b>goal</b>. This tells the system that you intend to complete this content and want to track your progress towards it. The platform keeps track of your goals and the order in which you want to complete them. It uses this to form your <b>queue</b>. This is a list of content that will take you through the prerequisites you need to complete your goals, and the goals themselves. Your queue will exclude any content that you've already completed, reducing repetition as you work toward your goals.</p>

<h2>Learning Paths</h2>

<p> A <b>learning path</b> is a predefined sequence of goals that takes you through a particular topic. Learning paths are created by other users, including academics, teachers and other experts in the field. You can choose to follow a learning path, or you can create your own by selecting individual pieces of content as goals.</p>

<h2>Navigating Content Pages</h2>

<p>On each page, including this one, there is a section called "Management" which contains buttons to help you manage your goals and queue. This contains a number of icons which are explained below:</p>

<table>

	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>

<p>Different buttons will be shown depending on the state of the content (e.g. whether it is already in your queue or marked as complete). You can also hover over each button to see a tooltip explaining what it does. Each button also has alt-text which can be read by screen readers.</p>

<p>This page is a special page - it will remain at the front of your queue until you have completed it.</p>

<p>Some pages will have sections for Prerequisite material so you can see the content you need to complete before viewing that page, and manage them within your queue. Some sections will have a section for related content that may be of interest but is not a prerequisite. Have a look at that section on this page and add any content that interests you to the start or end of your queue.</p>

<p>In the Management section below, click the button to complete this introduction and, if you have other goals set, go to the next item in your queue.</p>
