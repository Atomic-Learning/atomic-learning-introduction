<h2>Welcome to the Atomic Learning Platform</h2>

<p> Welcome to the Atomic Learning platform! The Atomic Learning platform is designed to provide a wide range of teaching resources created by experts across Imperial College London. The platform itself provides tools to allow you to navigate through these resources easily and effectively. When you first start using the Atomic Learning Platform you will be guided through a short tutorial to help you get acquainted with its features and functionalities.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>The content on the Atomic Learning platform is divided into a large number of different pages. Each page is intended to be the smallest useful unit of information. The word "Atomic" in "Atomic Learning" derives from the greek word "atomos" meaning indivisible - hence the name of the platform. Each page will note which other pages are a <b>prerequisite</b> to it, forming a web of interconnected knowledge.</p>

<h2>Goals and Your Queue</h2>

<p> Within the platform you can designate a piece of content as a <b>goal</b>. This tells the system that you intend to complete this content and want to track your progress towards it. The platform keeps track of your goals and the order in which you want to complete them. It uses this to form your <b>queue</b>. This is a list of content that will take you through the prerequisites you need to complete your goals, and the goals themselves.</p>

<h2>Learning Paths</h2>

<p> A <b>learning path</b> is a predefined sequence of goals that takes you through a particular topic. Learning paths are created by other users, including academics, teachers and other experts in the field. You can choose to follow a learning path, or you can create your own by selecting individual pieces of content as goals.</p>
